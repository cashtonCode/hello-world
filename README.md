Hey me,

I'm just here going throug the tutorial learning about commits and and commit messages.
After this screen I'll be putting a little message to say why I'm doing this.

My short-term goal with GitHub is to store all of my program files from all the CSCI classes so far.
My long-term goal with GitHub is to develop the two apps I've had ideas for and learn about databases.
